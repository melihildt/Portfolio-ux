            <p>With a new area of Design and Innovation on IT Resources with the team we propose ourselves redesign the website
                like a good opportunity to reflect the changes inside the company, attract new clients and continue adding
                interested people to be part of the team.

            <p class="has-text-weight-bold title is-5">Analysis and research</p>
            <p>This process lasted a few weeks where I participated in the research and analysis stage with the principal goal
                to get to know the market and the audience to which we pointed, listen all the stakeholders, define the goals
                of the site and identify the needs of the company.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>I was in charge of documenting all the process, scripting and making the interviews, transcribe and identify
                the concrete needs to every one of them and the vision about the culture’s company to define the voice and
                the content to this channel of information.</p>

                <br/> Information about the culture’s company? A section that allows them to leave their contact information to
                new jobs? Develop a software? Be able to know the schedules of the english classes? Be able to know the discounts
                and the benefits of work in the company?</p>

    <div class="column is-5 is-offset-1 mobileCostados">
        <p>We conducted internal and external surveys to capture the innovative style we wanted to represent and offer a functional
            product: We asked what they were looking for a software factory's website, if it seemed relevant to them when
            looking for a job, which were more attractive and better captured what they were looking for.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="has-text-weight-bold">With all the information discovered, we co-create Personas and User Journeys to define our users and contemplate
            differents possible scenarios.</p>

                <p>This stage gave us the possibility of knowing a little more about the organizational structure of the company,
                    understand how we could facilitate the work of many people in the company: an efficient intranet, a channel
                    of information and news with new projects and to launch, a portal of internal and external searches for
                    the recruiting area, among other things. We also identify the need for a new identity through rebranding
                    exercises.</p>
